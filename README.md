### Hi, I'm Shukrullo ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸŽ“ I am passionate about Computer Vision,Robotics, NLP.
- ðŸ“š I'm currently reading [Probabilistic Robotics](https://docs.ufpr.br/~danielsantos/ProbabilisticRobotics.pdf) and [Underactuated Robotics](http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/)
- ðŸ˜… Sometimes, I turn into a hardcore perfectionist, I set unrealistic goals and SUFFER. 


I'm best reached via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shukrullo-nazirjonov/). I'm always open(maybe not at the moment) to interesting conversations and collaboration(Kaggle, Projects, Papers).
