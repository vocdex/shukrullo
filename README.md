### Hi, I'm Shukrullo 👋


- 🎓 I am passionate about Computer Vision,Robotics, NLP.
- 📚 I'm currently reading [Probabilistic Robotics](https://docs.ufpr.br/~danielsantos/ProbabilisticRobotics.pdf) and [Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2022/ml-pytorch-book.html)
- 😅 Sometimes, I turn into a hardcore perfectionist, I set unrealistic goals and SUFFER. 
##
**🌱 I’m currently learning**

🙇🏻‍♀️ The fundamental concepts of deep supervised learning(GANs, NLP) as I am fairly new to the field.   
🔧 More advanced uses of Python (Flask,FastAPI) and PyTorch.

I'm best reached via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shukrullo-nazirjonov/). I'm always open(maybe not at the moment) to interesting conversations and collaboration(Kaggle, Projects, Papers).
